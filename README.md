# Human Cities
Every day, people track millions of activities with Human. We visualized 7.5 Million miles of activity in major cities all across the globe to get an insight into Human activity. Walking, running, cycling, and motorized transportation data tell us different stories.

All GPS data is plotted with R, without any mapping. Source:
